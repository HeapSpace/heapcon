Through a live demonstration of a complex analog synthesizer, I'll take a deep look at decoupled design, and learnings from Ricardo's last year of rebuilding - over 400 repositories dozens of services and apps, and a brand-new platform - and my own journey into modular synthesis. A musical and architectural exploration in design, creativity, and emerging standards in a chaotic world.
