Device connectivity is one of the most common issues IoT developers need to solve. Having an open source solution based on the standardized protocols that solves recurring connectivity problems is a very useful tool to have.

Meet Eclipse Hono, a cloud-based IoT connectivity platform which provides remote interfaces for device connectivity and mechanisms for uniform interaction with devices regardless of the communication protocol.
