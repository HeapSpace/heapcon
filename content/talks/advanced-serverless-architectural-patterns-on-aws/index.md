As serverless architectures become more popular, developers need a framework of patterns to deploy their workloads without managing servers or operating systems, without friction or operational heavy lifting. This session will describe reusable advanced patterns while considering costs as well. At the same time, we’ll consider operational and security best practices and discuss potential pitfalls and nuances.

<!--
This session is intended for an intermediate/advanced audience of software developers, but based on your feedback it could include a very brief overview of serverless computing topics. The presentation is focused on reusable architectural patterns to build software systems in the cloud without managing, patching, or provisioning servers/clusters. Even though most of the examples will be related to the AWS cloud, many of these serverless patterns can be considered cloud-agnostic and easy to reuse elsewhere.
