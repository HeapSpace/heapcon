title: "Improving your Git workflows"
---

I would start by explaining how Git works internally. How Git stores and how Git is collection of shell scripts.
The I'm going to share git shell scripts that can make developers live with git easier like: `git undo`, `git rebase-on-master`, `git delete-merged` and other smaller tricks.

I'm going finish with advice about workflows in general.
