title: "What I learned about Serverless from building a Pokémon Radar"
---

In this talk I will tell you about how I built a PokémonGo radar as a side project that taught me valuable lessons on Serverless architectures. The service had to be free, reliable, fast and not overwhelm external APIs. We will go over how, to meet those constraints, it went from a simple Heroku app to a serverless system with lambdas running in 6 different parts of the world. I will also go over how this experience shaped real-life decisions in my team at The Financial Times, where speed, reliability and cost play a big role in our architectural decisions.
