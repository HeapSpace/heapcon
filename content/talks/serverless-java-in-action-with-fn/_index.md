Serverless computing and FaaS (Function as a Service) are the new blacks! They radically change how software is organized, deployed, and charged for.

This hands-on session will introduce you to Fn Project, an open source FaaS platform. And although Fn is by design polyglot (ex. Go & JavaScript), we will mostly focus on Java and related JVM topics (ex. Spring Cloud Function, Serverless Kotlin). We will also discuss an functions orchestration using the Fn Flow API, a distributed Promise based API, to compose multiple functions into meaningful applications.

Attend this session to see that Java is not antinomic to Serverless!
