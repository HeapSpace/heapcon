title: "Animations Everywhere!"

Animations and Transitions are an important UX aspect for any application. I'll be talking about how it has been part of our everyday experience that we have started to ignore.

I am looking to get into the details on how to implement Animations and Shared element transitions for both iOS and Android using Javascript. Will also get into the details on how the same concept can be used for other platforms as well.
