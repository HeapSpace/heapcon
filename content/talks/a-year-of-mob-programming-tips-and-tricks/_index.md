title: "A year of mob programming - tips and tricks"
---

Mob programming is when the whole development team works on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space and with one shared computer. I've been working in a development team where we've been mob programming for well over a year, every day, without exceptions. We noticed an enormous boost in productivity as we used the team's overall brain capacity to solve problems and to ship high quality software. But it was not always easy. We've learned to master this way of working the hard way, by continuously improving on our processes, which I’ll share in this presentation.
