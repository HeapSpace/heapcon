We are all working towards one single goal. To create a best user experience. But most of the time we are wrong about what we think is good for the user. We usually have no idea if a feature is useful to the user until it is used by the customers.

My talk is about letting the users help you understand what they need and if a particular feature is really useful for the users by using the technique of A/B testing. At Booking.com we are constantly running A/B tests to improve the customer experience by measuring the business metrics.

Audience attending my talk would learn how to run A/B tests in their company at scale and what it takes to build the optimal tests.
