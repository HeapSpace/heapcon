So you are requested by your management to optimise, centralise, automatise... something? Innovate, bring new customers, raise the level of satisfaction of existing ones, be more efficient? Your answer is - the magic wand of Digital Transformation! But where to start? Why is choosing the right software tool just the last step in the process? Join us a for a first ever Business & Beer Session where we intend to bring people like you together and bounce of ideas of each other, share experiences and help wade through all the BS surrounding the topic of Digital Transformation. This time we are joined by a successful Serbian entrepreneur who will share some of his insights on the topic with us, who sold his business and is now bringing Digital Transformation to the craft beer scene. Oh, and did we mention that there will be free beer?
