We’ll introduce the current state of PWAs, available platforms, compatibility, business and technical challenges. We will get deep into the Android’s WebAPK system and we will see how to increase installation rates through banners and dialog APIs, and what happens after the PWA was installed and the user encounters a link to our web server.

We will talk about how to get our PWA into stores, including official support on Microsoft Store, the usage of Web Trusted Activites for Android's Play Store and solutions for iOS and mac AppStore, including the new Capacitor framework to create native PWAs.
