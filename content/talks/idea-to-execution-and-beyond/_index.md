title: "Idea to Execution and Beyond"
---

A high-level run-through of what it takes to execute and launch a project. I cover the idea stage, build process, launch, and what to expect post-launch. Idea validation, shipping anxiety, and customer development are just a few of the themes covered. The goal is for attendees to come away from the talk feeling focused and inspired to take their project to the next level. Because various stages are covered, there's value for everyone irrespective of what stage they're at. However, I've found that attendees who get the most from it are those who have been sitting on an idea or have not yet fully committed to their vision.
