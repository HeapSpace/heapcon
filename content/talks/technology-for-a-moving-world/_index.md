TomTom builds technology for a moving world. We help drivers – human or computer – to drive the 1.2 billion cars in the world safely. Every day, all over the world, moving goods and people where they need to go. In 1984, TomTom started mapping the world for navigation applications that help drivers find their way from A to B, eliminating the need for paper maps. Later, in 2006, we developed global traffic services and connected navigation applications so drivers could outsmart traffic congestion altogether. Currently, we fight range anxiety for drivers navigating in their electric vehicles, making sure they don’t run out of batteries. Going forward, we are already enabling automated vehicles to see beyond their physical sensors by remapping the world with centimeter accuracy. We’re building applications that assist people as they drive, or even drive a car all on its own – more safely and more efficiently than human drivers can.
