title: "Using Chaos Engineering for Building Resilient Systems"
---

Chaos Engineering takes the complexity of a distributed system and test it holistically by simulating turbulent conditions and observing how the system responds and performs. The data collected allows to build more resilient applications and improves observability of the system. This talk will provide an an introduction to the history, need and principles of Chaos Engineering. Attendees will learn how to perform Chaos Engineering experiments, collect data, identify the weakness and fix the system. Attendees will learn different tools like Istio, Chaos Toolkit, Kube Monkey and other open source offerings and how to conduct experiments using them.
