title: "What if Spring framework disappeared for a week?"
---

This talk is inspired by tweet of my friend. What would java developers do if they weren’t allowed/couldn’t use spring for their next project? Would it be instantly doomed?

Or would it open their eyes on different views and possibilities?

We’ll talk about spring, but actually it’ll be just example of great and very successful framework that sometimes can make us forget about alternatives and about critical thinking.
