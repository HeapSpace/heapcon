After we understand how important Web Performance is and we've applied basic techniques, what's next? In this session, we will cover extreme techniques that will blow your mind about Web Performance. New compression algorithms? new image formats? Client Hints? HTTP/2 Push? Let's hack Web Performance.

After quickly reviewing current metrics and goals for web performance, we will get deeply into advanced hacks to increase perception and performance on the web and PWAs.

We will cover the updated checklist of techniques to improve experience and perception and recent additions and hacks, such as: the usage of HTTP/2 push or not, QUIC, how to replace PNGs and JPEGs, HTTP Client Hints, better compression encoding algorithms available, browser's prefetching and lazy loading new abilities and how advanced techniques on top of Service Workers can help improving conversion and reduce user's frustration.

We'll cover some extreme new ideas, such as serving ATF content in 14Kb, using magician tricks or using new APIs to do reactive performance optimizations.

We will finally talk about how we always underestimate the Web on mobile devices and what we can learn from the AMP framework.
