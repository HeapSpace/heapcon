Have you ever worked on a legacy project, like lots of source code, but no unit tests? Or no continuous delivery? Static code analysis completely missing, or even a simple code standard totally absent?

Projects like these are still more often the case than we like to think. In fact, maybe you are a developer stuck in such a project, even though you have tried to raise these issues as problems? Were you told that is gold-plating, or simply too much work to fix?

I would like to share my experiences from a couple of such projects, both from the perspective of a tech lead in a project like this, and as a software reviewer (i.e. doing software auditing). But most important: I would like to help you with some good arguments, to convince your project leader why these things matter.
