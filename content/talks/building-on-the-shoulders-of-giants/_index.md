This talk will cover how Nutanix build a scale-out distributed hyper-converged system using available open source components such as Cassandra, Zookeeper, KVM etc. While these open-source products provide a good a starting point for product development, layers of abstraction and customization eventually leads to having to understand and owning of the sources of these complex products.
