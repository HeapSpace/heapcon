It took us a while, but we’re finally waking up to the fact that the convenience of the all-connected Internet has led us to giving away our data and personal freedoms. While some look towards legislation as a solution, groups of technologists are working on reinventing the Web with decentralized technology. 

We’ll explore the Dat project – a p2p protocol that builds on top of the existing Web – that gives the ability to own and edit data back to the people. Dat applications are designed to work offline, without the assumption of connectivity.
