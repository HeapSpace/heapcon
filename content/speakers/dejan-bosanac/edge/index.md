The session will summarize all the aspects of Edge computing, its current state and future trends. We'll start by introducing use cases that require this new type of architecture. Next, we'll go into the challenges when you go beyond your typical cloud infrastructure. Finally, we'll dig into the current state of the development with special focus on Kubernetes community and projects around it.

<!--
There's a new trend emerging where developers are trying to put their services closer and  closer to the users and devices they are connecting. For that they need to step out of the cloud infrastructure and deploy in the more distributed environments. But of course, we still want to keep all the tools and comfort we're used to developing pure cloud-native native solutions. Enter the Edge Computing, trying to extend cloud-native computing beyond the data center. In this session, we'll try to get you interested into this topic, talking about why and how you can start introducing Edge computing into your projects.
