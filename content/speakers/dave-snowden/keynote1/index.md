A lot of bright ideas - the Agile Manifesto, Design Thinking, Appreciate Inquiry - start off well but then get industrialized into a plethora of competing methods, certification schemes and the like to the overall detriment of the field. Based on over a year of research and longer practice Snowden will outline a complexity-based approach to design in general and IT development in specific.  Avoiding industrialization of novelty is the key to scalability and we need a few radical resets with the wider Agile movement. How to do exactly that, a form of re-wilding agile, will be a focus of this presentation.
