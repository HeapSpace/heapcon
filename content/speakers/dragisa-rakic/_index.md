Addicted to the computer world since ZX Spectrum glorious days, and Kraftwerk's Computer World. Amiga, Sony Playstation, SGI Indigo and PowerPC were great companions through chasing Computer Science Master degree ad FTN, Novi Sad University. I have more than 20 years of professional experience, used to work in startups, big corporations, as a freelancer, independentantly, in small teams, also in big international distributed environments. Nowadays, I work as a team leader for the mobile technologies and big data in one big international company. Currently strong specialized in Mobile technologies (both leading platforms), but my interest goes far beyond. I like to explore, learn and discover the magic of the software making. Also, I like to build the scale model airplanes, fine tune car electronics & ecus, struggle to play guitar, and enjoy in HiFi. Have 3 kids, a wife and no pets. Enough for a 47-year-old :)
