As a teenager I was stunned by HiFi audio components. Both visual and sound impressions were so appealing, and those devices were also the result of the marvelous electronic engineering and applied art craftsmanship. Amongst them, the cassette decks were the most diverse ones, and one of the greatest showcases how a "problem" could have literally countless solutions. Nowadays, those devices, if not dumped, are somewhere in the basement or attic. Let's bring their beautiful LED VU-meters back to life by the magic of Raspberry Pi, Android and iOS. Want to see how QT, Kotlin and Swift work together?

I would like to get the second life to the coolest devices of the 80's and early 90's of XX century: cassette decks. I will use Raspberry Pi, Android and iOS devices to accomplish this mission, also as a pair of the OpAmps and auxiliary electronics to merge GPIO of the Pi with the existing deck vintage electronics . A fusion of the different programming techniques, architectures, environments and even hardware building should be the great endeavour and even greater pleasure at the same time. In short: Cassette Deck of the 21st century, with no moving parts, wifi playlist management, and remotely controlled via smartphones.
