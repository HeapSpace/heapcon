The key to finding the optimal solution to a problem is to threefold: maximise the number of tools in your ‘personal tool box’; know all their capabilities and uses; and to know which tool is best suited to fix the particular problem in front of you.

This talk will enable you to grow all three aspects around load testing.

It will look at what it means to ‘load test’ your application, how to get started with writing your first script and provide you with a case study and an insight as to the tools and techniques that we use here at the FT to identify performance issues."
