Ally is a design lead at Field Intelligence. She’s worked on a broad array of projects – from public health software for NGOs and non-profits, to shiny brand experiences at agencies like Edenspiekermann and A Color Bright. She’d like to live in a place where sunscreen is a necessity, but makes do in Berlin. She travels as much as humanly possible, and spends a lot of her time working in West Africa.
