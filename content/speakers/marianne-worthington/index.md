Described as brilliant, hilarious, awesomesauce and so engaging you’ll forget to eat your snacks, Marianne has trained over 10,000 people in nearly every state. Recently she was recognized as one of the top trainers in America. She is the founder of Work Warrior, a company that helps managers become rockstars. In 2018 she decided to launch her second brand, Sequins and Superheroes, where she helps people manage themselves, and become the hero of their own story.

Before deciding to go out on her own, Marianne spent over a decade in corporate America in leadership and management roles. She discovered people can learn to be a good managers. However, not if they can’t manage themselves, their fears, their biases, and their emotions. In 2010 Marianne received her Master’s in Organizational Development from Avila University.

Marianne grew up in Kansas City, and now resides in Lincoln, Nebraska. She loves glitter, superhero shirts, exclamation points, and Mini Coopers. She prides herself on being a mediocre road warrior and loves collecting stamps in both her National Park passport and her real one! She speaks fluent emoji and when she isn’t traveling you can find her running around town with her mini golden doodle named AlexanderHamilton.
