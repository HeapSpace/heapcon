With TensorFlow and Cloud AI from Google, anyone can leverage deep learning technology at low cost and without much ML expertise. In this session, we will explore examples of business that have adopted TensorFlow and Cloud AI to solve their real-world problems from cucumber farmers to food manufacturers.

<!--
TensorFlow, the open source library for machine learning from Google, has been democratizing the world of machine intelligence since its launch in 2015. With TensorFlow, combined with the scalability of Googleâ€™s Cloud AI Platform, now anyone can leverage deep learning technology at low cost and without much expertise. We will explore examples of business that have adopted TensorFlow and Cloud AI to solve their real-world problems: a cucumber farmer in Japan who was able to build a deep learning-based cucumber sorter by himself, a used car auction service using TF for classifying car models and parts, and a food manufacturer that has been able to increase productivity significantly in their baby food factory.
