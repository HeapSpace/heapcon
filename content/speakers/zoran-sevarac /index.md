Deep learning is one of the key technologies that drives AI innovation. Typical software developer usually lack mathematical background required to fully understand workings and opportunities that deep learning brings. This session gives overview of main deep learning concepts that are relevant for understanding how can deep learning enhance enterprise applications, and how to implement those enhancements using popular frameworks and tools.
Participants will learn what kind of problems deep learning can solve, how to start building deep learning based solutions and best practice for integrating them into enterprise applications.

<!--
The idea of this session is to help software developers to quickly get on the right track with deep learning and understand what it can do for them, and how to implement it in their applications. Although there is a lot of materials on this topic, it is usually hard for typical software developer to get started, without going back to school and re-learning all the math they missed/skipped.  Also it gives high level ideas what kind of problems it can solve, how to approach those problems, what are the best practice etc.
