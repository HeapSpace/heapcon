Marko Ferek, author of the bestseller and currently the third most selling book in Croatia „Hyperactive dreamers – different, worse, better“, is a pioneer of bringing, using and popularising biofeedback technology in Croatia and the East Europe region. He gave more than 500 talks to teachers, professionals, parents, and children and held presentations across Canada, China, Ireland, Slovenia, the United Kingdom, and other countries. Besides bringing biofeedback technology closer to professionals in the field and parents, he is currently advocating for a complete educational system reform where child’s mental health and personal growth would be as equal as academic success, or even more important. He sees the use of biofeedback technology in educational institutions and everyday lessons as one of the paths to achieve it.
