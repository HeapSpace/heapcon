Biofeedback and edu-feedback technology is currently a very exciting area in which new ideas emerge on a daily basis. Results and devices within biofeedback technology opens a whole new way of teaching, therapy planning and executing. The results achieved by using biofeedback technology in the classroom and while working with students with special needs or disability are skyrocketing. The idea is to start the dialogue about implementing and using those technologies in everyday educational system but also talking about the struggles (and benefits) both programmers, engineers, distributors, and education workers experience in using bio and edu-feedback technology.

This session encourages the conversation about biofeedback software, its implementation, and education about its use, as well as open source biofeedback technology.
