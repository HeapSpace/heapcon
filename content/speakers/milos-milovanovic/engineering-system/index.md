Every company aims to have millions of customers, dominate the market, have a fast innovation pace, and all of that with a relatively small development team. Software at scale puts huge pressure on a development team since not only features but also issues occur in a fast pace and will bounce back to the development team in the form of an almost infinite stream of production incidents.

No tool can fix this; neither can one size fit all methodologies, teams that excel at building software services have a systematic approach to how they develop software - an established Engineering System (ES).

Engineering System for software development can be imagined as scaffolding in civil engineering. ES is a system which ideally helps “good” changes reach production as soon as possible and stops “bad” changes in early stages. More importantly, Engineering System helps spot production design issues before even noticed by customers. The ultimate goal of ES is to help engineering teams prioritize their future work better according to the needs and usage of their actual customers.

As Ernest Hemingway said: “In order to write about life first, you must live it.” The approach to building ES covered in this talk came from years of experience of developing some of the world-leading software services in Microsoft and now in Nutanix.
