Have you ever thought about speaking at a conference? Have you ever wondered how the speakers managed to get into the conference?

I am afraid of public speaking, I usually speak fast and Iâ€™m asthmatic. None of that stopped me to accomplish my dream of sharing knowledge and give to the community as much as I have gotten from the community.

I will share with you how I managed to speak at events across Europe and US, and how thanks to the advice from other speakers and mentors, I manage to overcome my fears and limitations. Hopefully you will leave the session wanting to share your knowledge with others!

<!--
I want with this talk to motivate others to share their experiences and create new talks. Sharing knowledge with other will help people progress, and to challenge themselves is a way to become a better version of ourselves.
