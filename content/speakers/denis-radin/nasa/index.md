Jet Propulsion Laboratory â€“ scientific institution making a lot of research and development for NASA. JPL have been developing software for most of unmanned missions in the field of deep space exploration including such missions as Curiosity and Voyager. High level of automatization and long duration of missions led to superior demands to software quality.

As a result of JPL amazing experience, a set of code guidelines was developed and published recently. Since demands to web-driven software constantly increase and more critical tasks are entrusted to JavaScript, lets apply NASA coding guidelines to JavaScript / HTML applications for higher performance, reliability and the better world.

Topic raises the question which is still important. Why would you be scared to fly airplane having software built with web technologies? And how to change this perception of web developers writing low quality software.
