Peter is a developer advocate in Samsung's mobile web browser (Samsung Internet) team. He enjoys helping web developers to make the most of the web platform, especially up-and-coming Web APIs. In recent months he has been exploring and sharing about PWAs, Web Payments, WebXR and Web Bluetooth. He has been a developer since 2003, previously working at a “future technologies” lab at an education company and as a tech lead at a national newspaper and two web development agencies. He recently started providing some mentoring to web developers remotely and in person, and finds teaching the best way to learn!
