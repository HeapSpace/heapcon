This talk focuses primarily on implications of forced compartmentalization of specializations on various aspects of a company, and how we can improve the existing processes. The classic linear product management cycle is built around the notion of a “handoff” to development - where business, design and product do all the research and engineers do development timelines, feasibility assessments and actual implementation.

I’ll argue that modern dynamic product cycles, that are by nature dynamic, circular and iterative, greatly benefit from including engineers into the product management process - and what kind of implications this can have on the general well-being of engineers as well as the overall end-product quality.

I’ll also offer a few simple hacks we can do on a daily basis to properly integrate engineers into product discovery processes.
