This talk focuses primarily on implications of forced compartmentalization of specializations on various aspects of a company, and how we can improve the existing processes.
The classic linear product management cycle is built around the notion of a “handoff” to development - where business, design and product do all the research and engineers do development timelines, feasibility assessments and actual implementation. 
The problem here is that good developers are not just implementers of ideas, they are the originators and catalysts of ideas.
We’re constantly seeing negative implications on the well-being of engineering teams, when they’re not listened to or included in the product discovery process - such as disconnection from the rest of the team, feeling unappreciated, uninspired and even burnt out.
Going further, the modern product lifecycle is not a linear process  -  it is dynamic, circular and iterative, and engineers can play a crucial product development role as we can provide the functional perspective, constraint framing, generally great ideas focused on problem solving and our own user perspective that we’ve built by having a deep understanding of the product we work on every day.
In a world where engineers are a rare and expensive company asset it seems unreasonable to continue with the classic linear product management process. 
In the talk I’ll offer a few simple hacks we can do on a daily basis to properly integrate engineers into product discovery processes.
