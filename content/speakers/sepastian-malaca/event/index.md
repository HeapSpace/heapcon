Event-driven architecture allows you to observe, collect, analyze, and react dynamically to real-time events.  Since most of functionalities of our applications are reactions on some requests or situations it's worth to know advantages of event processing and event-driven architecture.

Ability to recognize events we have to react on make as more aware of the domain we have to work with. Including them into our applications makes our software more cohesive, granular and easier to understand, extend and modify.

During the talk you will learn what event processing is. What are the differences between event processing and event sourcing. I will describe major concepts of event-driven architecture and tell you how to design event processing applications.
