Containers are the next best thing after sliced bread, but do you really need containers? Join this talk to discuss the different scenarios where containers can really help — or get in your way — when deploying your applications. We'll examine the different patterns and a few examples of go and no-go scenarios for containers.

<!--
There's a great movement towards containerizing a company's infrastructure. While in many cases this includes many benefits in terms of resilience and agility, there are times where going to containers is not a good option. During the talk, we'll discuss some anti-patterns of moving to containers and we'll try to examine the different cases, where moving to containers presents real benefits for the business.
