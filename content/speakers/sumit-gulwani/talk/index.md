Programming by examples (PBE) is a new frontier in AI that enables users to create code fragments from input-output examples. Some killer applications of PBE are in the areas of data wrangling and robotic process automation to automate tasks such as string/datatype transformations (e.g., converting “FirstName LastName” to “LastName, FirstName”), table extraction from semi-structured documents (like text-files, webpages, spreadsheets, PDFs), and repetitive editing/refactoring for documents/code. Creating usable PBE systems involves developing efficient search algorithms (to search for programs over an underlying domain-specific programming language), and ambiguity resolution techniques (to select an intended program from among the many that satisfy the examples). This presentation will educate the audience about this new PBE-based programming paradigm: its applications, form factors inside different products (like Excel, PowerBI, Visual Studio, Jupyter Notebooks), and the science behind it.
