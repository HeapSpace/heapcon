Security should be an integral part of any development project and not an afterthought. This is also true for REST APIs. In this talk, we will try to show what the industry standards are for securing REST. Uncovering the pros and cons for most popular security protocols, such as basic auth, OAuth 2.0. We will dig into stateful vs stateless security implementations, as well as how to properly use JWTs and how you can use digital signature to secure your APIs using HTTP signatures.
