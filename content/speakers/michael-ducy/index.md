Born on the rolling plains of central Illinois corn fields, Michael Ducy started his technology journey at a young age. Always curious, he was once threatened that he’d never have toys bought for him again if he didn’t stop taking them apart to see how they worked. Raised in a blue collar family, his first workbench was given to him at the age of 5. His first programming language was BASIC, at the ripe young age of 6. Michael quickly saw the parallels between building physical objects on his workbench, and building virtual objects with his computer. Still an avid woodworker, Michael finds joy in helping people understand technology and the impact it has on the work that we do, and the lives that we lead.
