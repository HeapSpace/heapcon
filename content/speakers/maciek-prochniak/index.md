More than 10 years of experience, currently usually as architect/(lead) developer - but my roles vary from analysis to ops. Most of it Java & Scala. My main fields of interest are integration (Camel, OSGi) and stream processing systems (Akka, Kafka, Flink) but I also did my share of "enterprise" systems with Spring, Hibernate and so on. I also like to give talks at conferences - Confitura, JEEConf, VoxxedDays just to name a few.
