  tuning of cloud functions to build a reliable massively scalable cloud
  computing platform.

I’ll talk about how to design serverless architecture for a data intensive application in order to process a Data Lake or data streams. I’ll show you how we did it using AWS cloud functions on Node.js running on thousands functions in parallel that process terabytes of data in ETL pipeline. Step by step we will build a serverless architecture for processing pipeline, consider the choice of services, queues, streams, databases and dive into tuning of cloud functions to build a reliable massively scalable cloud computing platform. We will talk about the advantages of such an architecture and platform, its possible limitations and how to get around them.
