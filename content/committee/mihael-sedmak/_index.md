Mihael has been a Java developer since 2004, working in different roles in teams small and large â€“ from software development and design to leading development companies. Since software delivery is still a large part of his professional passion, he lately focused on finding better ways of delivering software projects and products using different JVM languages, Kotlin in particular, as well as applying Agile principles and practices in daily work.
