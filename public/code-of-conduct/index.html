<h1 id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h1>

<p>Heapcon acknowledges that harassment has been a real, long-standing issue in the tech community. We also acknowledge that the technology sector is not wholly representative of the diverse makeup of our society.</p>

<h2 id="let-us-be-clear">Let us be clear</h2>

<p>We don’t approve harassment or offensive behavior, at our conferences or anywhere. It’s counter to our values. More importantly, it’s counter to our values as human beings.</p>

<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

<p>We’re voicing our strong, unequivocal support of appropriate behavior by all participants at technical events, including Heapcon conference. One issue that has come up at some technical conferences is sexual language, sexism and comments prejudice to various religious communities, the LGBTQIA community or people with disabilities. This is not appropriate, and we will sanction these action on the spot.</p>

<p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.</p>

<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.</p>

<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified as they&rsquo;ll be wearing branded clothing and/or badges.</p>

<p>Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.</p>

<p>We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related social events.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a community, and species, we should make sure that we continuously strive to improve, both in terms of social interactions &amp; technology.</p>
