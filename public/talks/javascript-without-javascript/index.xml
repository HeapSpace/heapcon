      <description>Patrick Kettner won an eighth grade talent show competition singing Gloria Gaynor’s 1978 disco hit “I Will Survive”, and things have been looking up ever since. He has traded in the golden microphone for a PM position on Microsoft Edge, as well as being the lead developer for Modernizr. He lives in Seattle with his wonderful partner Katrina, son Holden, and dog Baxter.</description>
