  <h1>What I learned about Serverless from building a Pokémon Radar</h1>

  <p><p>In 2017 I had been playing Pokémon on and off for about a year and had a few left to catch! Though pokemon tracking maps helped, I wondered, what if THE pokemon I wanted popped up when I wasn&rsquo;t looking? So I set out to build a service that would send me push notifications every time there was an important pokemon around. I had a few constraints. Whatever I built had to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Be free: I have one rule with this game, and it&rsquo;s to <em>never</em> spend money on it. Paying a cent to build this was off-limits.</li>
<li>Be reliable: The goal of this service was to make sure I never missed a pokemon I cared about. That meant no downtime.</li>
<li>Not overwhelm external dependencies</li>
<li>Be performant</li>
</ul>

<p>In this talk I share how I built this service: how, to meet those constraints, it went from a free Heroku app with a scheduler to a serverless system with lambdas running in 7 different parts of the world. We&rsquo;ll also go over how this experience shaped real-life decisions in my team at The Financial Times, where speed, reliability and cost play a big role in our architectural decisions.</p>
