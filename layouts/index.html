	<p>In light of recent COVID-19 updates, we would like to inform you that Heapcon will be postponed to the autumn of 2021.</p>

	<p>The current situation of uncertainty doesn’t allow for reliable planning and, despite our sincere efforts to be at the forefront of the coming recovery, we are not able to guarantee the best Heapcon experience to our audience, speakers, and partners. Less than the best just doesn’t cut it for us.</p>

	<p>Stay tuned for other projects, we are always cooking something and remember - 2021. is just down the road!</p>
