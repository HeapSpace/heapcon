	<p>If you have any concerns about the current COVID-19 outbreak, its status in Serbia or how it affects international mobility, you can get up-to-date information by checking
		<a href="https://covid19.rs/homepage-english/">this website</a> or asking us about any current insights.</p>
	<h3>CURRENT STATUS:</h3>
	<p>There is a temporary restriction for entry for international travelers, as well as active ban on public gatherings that count more than 50 people.</p>
	<p>At this point in time, we are assured by epidemiologists that by October, the pandemic will decline enough for travel bans to be lifted and public gatherings to be completely safe. Nevertheless, we will keep being vigilant and timely and transparently inform our speakers and audience on new developments. Don't hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns on this matter.</p>
