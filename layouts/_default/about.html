	Voxxed Days Belgrade 2015 was the first Devoxx-branded event in this part of Europe.
</p>

<p>
Noted the most numerous of all Voxxed Days events in both 2015 and 2016, we decided to scale back a bit this year.
</p>

<p>
Our focus was on feasible timetable, interesting topics and good speakers.
</p>

<p>
	International speakers: 45 in 2015, 95 in 2016.<br>
	Visitors: 550 in 2015, 800 in 2016.
